#Map App


Login.html, index.html and app.js has nothing now. 
wktdisplay.html uses ArcGIS Javascript API. it has everything in it to read a wkt, create a point 
in UTM15, reproject it to Lat Long and add it to map. 

the JS code also will catch the lat long of a clicked point and get Township/Range/Section.
